#HTML5 Workshop#
So what is this? It's an HTML5 workshop that I'm giving (first run at Strange Loop https://thestrangeloop.com/) The goal is simple: get people up to speed on HTML5. Here's the conference blurb:

##Conference Blurb##
This workshop is for web developers showing them how they can leverage HTML5 in the applications they are building today. We’ll start with a gentle overview describing just what HTML5 is all about and then we’ll delve into the details. We’ll look at the new elements HTML5 brings to the table, why canvas isn’t just something you find in the art department, how geolocation can find Waldo and much much more.
